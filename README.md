# HDTI HOMELAB

I will be building a homelab with [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/). On my homelab server, I will be installing:

* [Technitium DNS](https://technitium.com/dns/) as DNS server
* [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) as VPN
* [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/) as nas OS for managing data

I also will be building a kubernetes cluster with [kubeadmin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/).</br>
